/**
 * @module clone-auth
 *
 * Thin adapter over the unified token dispatcher in `github.token.ts` for
 * the deploy pipeline. The dispatcher (`tokenFor(userId, purpose, ctx)`)
 * already encodes the full priority chain; this file only translates the
 * deploy-specific `buildStrategy` discriminator into a `purpose`:
 *
 *   - buildStrategy="local"  → tokenFor(..., "local")
 *   - buildStrategy="server" → requireTokenFor(..., "remote")
 *
 * gh CLI tokens are never returned for "remote" — that policy lives in
 * `tokenFor("remote", ...)` and the rejection happens before this
 * function ever sees a token.
 *
 * Token priority (single source of truth — see github.token.ts):
 *   - purpose: "local"  → gh CLI > App > project > user-pat > OAuth
 *     (auto-resolved credentials first; gh is opt-in-gated for multi-user)
 *   - purpose: "remote" → project > user-pat > App > REFUSE (no gh CLI)
 *
 * This function owns the ORDER of the whole clone-credential chain; the steps
 * that aren't tokens live beside it here rather than in their own resolvers, so
 * there is one readable sequence. The order is the OPERATOR's precedence — the
 * self-hosted model has no GitHub App, so the operator's own switches come first:
 *
 *   1. FORWARD my git identity — the operator flipped "Forward my git identity to
 *      build servers" (Settings → Clone credentials) and a local `gh` exists:
 *      clone directly on the build host over the desktop relay, nothing persisted.
 *   2. the server's OWN pre-existing git access (ambient `gh`/helper/ssh, verified
 *      per repo; `anonymous` when the repo needs no credential at all).
 *   3. per-server stored identity (Server tab: device token / PAT / ssh key).
 *   4. App installation or PAT (`tokenFor("remote")`) — cloud mode; self-host has none.
 *   5. public repo → anonymous (fast-path API check; the step-2 probe is the authority).
 *   6. api-host clone + context transfer (docker only) — clone here, ship the source.
 *
 * Each step self-gates on its own inputs (a per-server cred needs a serverId, the
 * ambient probe needs a server executor, the relay needs desktop + the setting +
 * an SSH tunnel), so a step only fires when it CAN — precedence decides only when
 * several are available at once.

/**
 * Can a clone run ON THE BUILD HOST with this credential, or must it fall back to cloning on the

 *
 * ONE definition, because two would drift into a deploy that falls back while the UI promised it
 * wouldn't. It lived inline in `build-pipeline` as an unnamed boolean, which meant the only way to
 * find out whether "On the server" would actually work was to start a deploy and read the log.
 *
 * Five things qualify, and the reasons they do are not interchangeable:
 *   - `ambient`   — the server already has its own git access; nothing needs to move.
 *   - `ssh`       — a key we can ship and use there (server key or per-repo deploy key).
 *   - `relay`     — the desktop relay forwards the identity for the duration.
 *   - `anonymous` — a public repo needs no credential at all.
 *   - `token` WITHOUT `apiHostFallback` — an App/PAT usable off-host. The flag is the whole
 *     point: a token carrying it is a LOCAL credential for cloning on THIS host, so treating
 *     token-presence alone as "shippable" would send a credential somewhere it can't authenticate
 *     and leak it off-host on the way.
 *
 * The BARE runtime always clones on the target and is gated by preflight separately, so callers
 * apply this to the docker runtime only.
