/**
 * The asset name is a literal, and `linux-amd64` in it is NOT a host assumption.
 *
 * `.github/workflows/release.yml` packages exactly one openship artifact per tag —
 * `openship-${TAG}-linux-amd64.tar.gz` — and its payload is architecture-agnostic:
 * TypeScript the target runs under Bun, plus a prebuilt Next standalone. The only
 * native resolution happens in `bun install --production` on the target itself
 * (see OPENSHIP_CONFIG in openship-project.service.ts). So the suffix is the
 * publisher's naming, and templating `{os}-{arch}` here would ask GitHub for
 * `openship-v0.6.1-linux-arm64.tar.gz` — a file no release contains — turning a
 * working arm64 install into `ReleaseDistMissingError`.
 *
 * If openship ever ships per-arch artifacts, the template and the workflow's
 * ARTIFACT name change together; `renderAssetName` already supports the placeholders.
