 * bind mounts as YAML literals, because compose interpolation can't read
 * TypeScript. That is the one copy of `EDGE_CONTAINER_MOUNTS` we cannot delete —
 * so it gets asserted instead.
 *
 * This is not busywork: a mount present in the array but missing from this file
 * reaches `docker run`-based installs and NOT compose ones, and the failure mode is
 * an install that serves nothing while every unit test passes. The api and edge
 * must mount the SAME host paths at the SAME container paths, or the api writes
 * vhosts/certs somewhere the edge never reads — the exact bug this whole area was

 * out of `OPENSHIP_HOST_SSH_KEY`, which `.env.example` and the docs tell operators to
 * set to this exact value, and compose resolves the source. The two drifting apart is
 * the "Cannot read host SSH key" bug: the docs said to set the env var while this file
 * mounted nothing (#509). `/dev/null` is the default on purpose — it is what lets the
 * stack start on a box with no key at all, rather than compose creating a DIRECTORY at
 * a missing bind source.
