/**
 * THE UPDATE ITSELF: last release's stack, real data in it, recreated onto this
 * release's image. Real daemon, real Postgres, real containers.
 *
 * This is the case every other suite in the repo approximates and none of them runs.
 * `migrate-chain` (packages/db) proves the migration chain applies to a populated
 * database, but on PGlite — Postgres compiled to WASM, close but not the
 * `postgres:16-alpine` an operator actually has. Nothing anywhere booted the PREVIOUS
 * RELEASE and then updated it, which is the only sequence an existing user ever
 * performs, and the one that produced "openship-api-1 enters a crash loop after
 * `openship update`" from an operator whose 0.6.1 install was already unhealthy.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   1. Brings up postgres + redis + the PREVIOUS release's api image, waits for
 *      /api/health, and confirms that api actually migrated the database.
 *   2. Seeds rows into core tables, so what follows runs against a NON-EMPTY schema.
 *   3. Repins the api image to THIS release's and runs the same command
 *      `openship update` runs — `up -d --force-recreate api` — against the same
 *      volume, same .env, same network.
 *   4. Asserts the new api reaches /api/health, applied the remaining migrations,
 *      kept every seeded row, and did NOT bounce on the way (RestartCount 0 — a
 *      container that crash-looped its way to healthy is the failure being hunted).
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than `openship up`: postgres + redis + api, not edge/mail/
 * dashboard. The compose file below mirrors the shipped template for those three
 * services (apps/cli/src/lib/compose.ts) — how the CLI GENERATES that file is covered
 * by apps/cli/test/unit; what this owns is whether the update survives.
 *
 * Two inputs, because a checkout has neither side of an upgrade in it:
 *   OPENSHIP_E2E_NEW_API_IMAGE  the api image for the NEW side. CI passes the digest
 *                               `build-images` just pushed, so the bytes under test are
 *                               the bytes about to be tagged. Unset → built from this
 *                               checkout (slow, but makes the test runnable anywhere).
 *   OPENSHIP_E2E_OLD_VERSION    the release to upgrade FROM. Unset → the newest
 *                               `v*.*.*` tag that isn't the one at HEAD.
 *
 * Opt-in via `E2E_SCOPE=update` (see vitest.e2e.config.ts): it pulls a published
 * release, which a plain local checkout has no reason to do on every run.
