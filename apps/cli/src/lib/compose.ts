/**
 * PURE. Decide which account the container→host SSH channel logs in as, given the

 * Host operations need root. They do NOT need a root LOGIN — that is the distinction this
 * function used to miss. `privilegedExecutor` already elevates a non-root sudo session per
 * operation (packages/adapters/src/system/privilege.ts), and the deploy path, the
 * installer and the on-box state store all reach root that way. So a sudo-capable operator
 * gets a channel that logs in AS THEM and elevates, rather than one that mints a standing
 * root SSH credential to buy access the platform already had.
 *
 * Minting it was the old middle arm, and it bought a materially bigger blast radius than
 * the docker socket this channel is justified against — the argument this file already
 * makes about the key's own scope. It also broke boxes it was supposed to help: a host with
 * `PermitRootLogin no` (a normal hardening choice, and #527's likely shape) got a root
 * channel sshd refuses, after the working alternative had been revoked.
 *
 *   - invoked AS root              → already root, write /root directly. Nothing to mint.
 *   - non-root + passwordless sudo → log in as the invoker and ELEVATE per operation.
 *   - non-root, no sudo            → the invoker, with no route to root at all; flagged so
 *                                    the caller warns loudly.
 *
 * What still needs a root login, and is therefore degraded on the sudo arm: the host
 * TERMINAL is a PTY channel that no elevation decorator wraps, so it opens an unprivileged
 * shell (the operator types `sudo -i`). SFTP cannot be elevated either, which is why
 * `scratchDir()` exists beside `stateDir()` in adapters.
 *
 * An operator who WANTS a root channel runs the installer as root — `sudo openship up`
 * makes the invoker uid 0, and root is therefore the FIRST candidate on that arm. That is
 * deliberately the only way to end up with a standing root credential: this function will
 * not mint one for an account it is not logging in as.
 *
 * Why the root arm returns a SECOND candidate (#527): a root login is a request sshd is
 * free to refuse, and `PermitRootLogin no` is an ordinary hardening choice. Before this,
 * the root arm was terminal — the key went into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, sshd refused
 * every dial, and `.env` was written pointing at the refusal. When the run was `sudo`'d we
 * already know an account that CAN log in (the operator just used it), so `$SUDO_USER`
 * follows root as the fallback. It is only ever reached when root's dial actually fails,
 * so a working root install is never migrated out from under an operator who asked for it.
 *
 * Nothing has to move for that migration: the on-box state under /root/.openship is
 * reached through `privilegedExecutor`, which elevates.
 *
 * `carried` is promoted to the front when it names a candidate we already have, purely to
 * avoid re-authorizing (and then revoking) a file the previous run already settled away
 * from. It cannot introduce an account of its own — an account we would have to elevate
 * to write to is one we are not logging in as, which is the thing de-rooting removed.
 *
 * PURE: every account it can name is resolved by the caller (`plannedHostChannel`), so the
 * decision is testable without a passwd database or a live sshd.

 * Exported for tests: this decision is the whole fix, so it's verified directly.
