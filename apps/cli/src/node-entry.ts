// node-entry.ts — thin wrapper with a #!/usr/bin/env node shebang.
//
// npm reads the shebang of the `bin` file to generate the Windows launchers
// (openship.cmd / openship.ps1). dist/index.js uses #!/usr/bin/env sh — an
// intentional sh/JS polyglot that lets the official Bun-based installer run
// the CLI on Bun-only Unix boxes with no Node. On Windows, npm turns that `sh`
// into `sh.exe` calls, which don't exist on a standard install (#460).
//
// npm always ships Node, so this wrapper carries a plain `node` shebang and is
// the `bin` target: npm then emits correct launchers that call node.exe. On
// Unix it's equally valid — node runs the wrapper, which loads the fully
// bundled CLI. The polyglot dist/index.js is untouched and stays the exec
// target of the official curl/tarball installer on Bun-only boxes.
//
// ── It is also the Node-version gate, and that is why the import is dynamic ──
//
// `npm i -g openship` is the ONE install path that runs on the user's own Node.
// The curl installer resolves this itself (scripts/install.sh: system Node >= 22
// or it vendors an official Node 22), so it can never land on an old runtime —
// but npm/pnpm/yarn/bun installs land on whatever is there, and `engines` is only
// a WARNING unless the user set engine-strict.
//
// On Node 18 the result was: install exits 0, the bin links fine, and the command
// dies instantly with `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression flags` from
// string-width's `/v` flag — a transitive dependency the user has never heard of.
// That reads as a broken install, not as "wrong Node", and it cost at least one
// operator an afternoon of chasing the wrong thing.
//
// The check therefore has to run BEFORE the CLI bundle is evaluated, which rules
// out a static `import "./index.js"`: ESM evaluates a module's imports before its
// own body, so the SyntaxError would win the race and this file's message would
// never print. A dynamic import defers the load until after the gate. (tsup keeps
// `./index.js` external via the keep-index-external plugin — dynamic imports go
// through the same onResolve hook, so this stays a runtime load of the sibling
// bundle rather than a second inlined copy of the whole CLI.)
