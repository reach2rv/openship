/**
 * Deployment class — the single source of truth for the THREE orthogonal axes
 * that describe how a project deploys. Historically two boolean columns
 * (`hasBuild`, `hasServer`) each conflated two independent concerns, which is
 * how a Dockerfile app lost its clone token (issue #538, case A) and a portless
 * worker got routed through static file-serve and failed (case B).
 *
 *   source   — WHERE the deployable content comes from:
 *                "git"    → a repository we must clone (needs a token)
 *                "upload" → files staged out of band (folder upload / local dir);
 *                           no clone
 *                "image"  → a prebuilt artifact (registry image, pinned image, or
 *                           a release/dist tarball); no clone, no source build
 *   build    — HOW the image/artifact is produced:
 *                "dockerfile" → the repo ships its own Dockerfile
 *                "buildpack"  → openship runs the stack's install/build commands
 *                "static"     → a static site (files served by the edge)
 *                "prebuilt"   → nothing to build (image/release deploys verbatim)
 *   workload — WHAT runs after deploy:
 *                "web"    → a long-running server with a listening port + route
 *                "worker" → a long-running container with NO port and NO route
 *                           (queue consumer, cron, bot, …)
 *                "static" → no process; files served by the edge
 *
 * `resolveDeploymentClass` is `explicit override ?? derived-from-legacy-flags`,
 * the repo's established "null = derive" idiom (cf. `project.runtimeMode`). The
 * derivation reproduces the exact pre-#538 behaviour when no explicit value is
 * set, so every existing row and every frozen deployment snapshot classifies as
 * it did before — `worker` is reachable ONLY via an explicit `workloadType`.
 *
 * Pure, no I/O — lives in @repo/core so the db schema, API request validation,
 * openship.json config and the deploy pipeline all resolve identically.
