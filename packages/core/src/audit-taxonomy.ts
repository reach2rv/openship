/**
 * Audit event taxonomy — the one catalog both halves of the audit log read.
 *
 * It has to be shared because the two jobs are split across processes: the API
 * expands a category filter into the `event_type IN (...)` list (a category is
 * not a column), and the dashboard turns each row into a sentence. A copy in
 * either app would drift the moment someone added an event to only one of them,
 * which is exactly how the dashboard-only label file this replaces ended up
 * mapping `deployment.canceled` while the API emitted `deployment.cancelled`.
 *
 * Two kinds of event_type land in audit_event:
 *   1. Explicit `eventType: "..."` literals in apps/api (deploy lifecycle,
 *      Better Auth org hooks, billing crons, incident announcements).
 *   2. The secureRouter auto-emitter, which uses the route's permission tag
 *      verbatim — so `"project:write"` and `"server:admin"` are event types too.
 *      These are coarse by nature: one tag covers every write route under a
 *      resource, so their wording stays deliberately vague.
 *
 * `action` is a past-tense verb phrase, because the row is rendered as a
 * sentence — "Sarah deployed api-gateway", not "deployment.succeeded". `label`
 * is the same event stated without an actor, for the ~30% of rows written by
 * crons and webhooks where there is nobody to put in front of the verb.
 *
 * Labels stay in English here rather than in the dashboard's i18n bundles: the
 * API filters on these ids and the strings are operator-facing forensic terms,
 * the same call notification-categories.ts makes.
