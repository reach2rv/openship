/**
 * Docker runtime - manages containers via the Docker Engine API (dockerode).
 *
 * Supports three connection modes:
 *   - Local socket (default, zero config)
 *   - Remote via SSH tunnel (ssh2 streamlocal forwarding to Docker socket)
 *   - Remote via TCP + mutual TLS
 *
 * This is ONLY the runtime. Routing (Nginx) and SSL (certbot) are separate
 * infrastructure providers - see `infra/`.
 *
 * Build strategy:
 *   Builds from a staged source context sent to the Docker daemon. If the
 *   repository already provides a Dockerfile, that becomes the source of
 *   truth. Otherwise Openship generates a minimal builder Dockerfile.
 *   Deploy creates a container from the resulting image.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL:
 *   - SSH: uses the same configured credentials as the standard SSH executor
 *     (password, private key, or SSH agent).
 *   - SSH keys should be encrypted at rest and decrypted in memory only.
 *   - Host fingerprints can be pinned via `hostVerifier` (TOFU or strict).
 *   - TCP: mutual TLS (client cert + CA) - no plaintext TCP.

 *
 * There is no Docker API to kill a running exec (moby#9098): destroying the local
 * stream leaves the process running inside the container, so a prepare step that
 * retries 5× used to leave 5 live `sh` processes behind. Here the wrapper shell
 * arms a `sleep`+`kill` against its own child and reports the child's status, so
 * a timeout ends the remote process too.
 *
 * Three details are load-bearing:
 *  - the command is a POSITIONAL ARGUMENT (`$1`), never spliced into this script,
 *    so `sh -c <command>` semantics stay byte-identical to the unwrapped call and
 *    there is no new quoting surface;
 *  - the watchdog's fds go to /dev/null. A backgrounded `sleep` holding a copy of
 *    the exec's stdout pipe keeps that pipe from reaching EOF, which would make
 *    every fast command block for the whole timeout instead of returning at once;
 *  - `setsid` gives the command its own PROCESS GROUP so the deadline can signal
 *    the whole tree. `$!` only ever names the intermediate `sh`, and TERMing that
 *    alone reparents the actual command to PID 1 — still running, still holding
 *    the exec's stdout, which is the exact orphan this wrapper exists to prevent.
 *    Alpine's busybox `ash` hid the bug by exec-optimizing the inner shell away;
 *    on any Debian/Ubuntu-based image (dash AND bash 5) it leaked every time.
 *    `set -m` is not an alternative: dash and busybox refuse monitor mode with
 *    "can't access tty", and bash makes it work but prints job-status noise onto
 *    the command's stderr.
 *
 * `sleep && kill` (not `;`) so an image with no `sleep` simply has no watchdog
 * instead of killing the command instantly. Same reason `setsid` is probed rather
 * than assumed: no `setsid` degrades to the old single-child kill, never to a
 * command that won't start.

   * Nothing needs the buildx plugin either — BuildKit lives in the daemon.
