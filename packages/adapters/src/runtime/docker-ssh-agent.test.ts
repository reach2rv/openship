/**
 * Two things are guarded here, and the second is why the first ever mattered.
 *
 * 1. One dead Docker request must never kill the API process. `captureClient.fail()` used
 *    to `client.destroy(err)` after detaching the socket's only 'error' listener — an
 *    unhandled 'error' event that killed every project's tabs, not just the one failing
 *    request.
 * 2. A dead request must SAY WHY. A destroyed socket carries no cause: dockerode turns it
 *    into `socket hang up`, which is all a host with no running dockerd (the Amazon Linux
 *    report) ever showed. The bridge now writes a real HTTP 502 whose JSON body is the
 *    reason — the daemon's own stderr wherever there is any.
 *
 * A configured `dockerSocketPath` skips remote discovery and a failing `forwardUnixSocket`
 * drives the bridge to dial-stdio, so these paths run deterministically with no real ssh2.
