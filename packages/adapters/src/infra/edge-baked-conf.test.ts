/**
 * `apps/edge/nginx.conf` is COPYed into the edge image, so it can't read a TS
 * constant — yet most of what it contains is shared with the bare/remote edge,
 * which gets those same directives patched in from TypeScript. It used to be a
 * hand-maintained copy with three "keep in sync" comments, guarded by string
 * matches that would catch a rename but not a divergent VALUE.
 *
 * It is now generated. This file is the guard on that: the checked-in conf must
 * equal its generator, and the properties worth naming are asserted against the
 * generator, so breaking one gives you its name rather than a whole-file diff.
