/**
 * OpenResty Lua deployment - reads dedicated .lua files and writes them
 * to the managed server via the CommandExecutor (SSH / local shell).
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   No external dependencies on the managed server - everything runs on
 *   ngx.shared.dict zones in OpenResty shared memory.  No Redis, no
 *   file I/O on the hot path.
 *
 * Lua scripts live in ./lua/ as proper .lua files (readable, lintable,
 * editable with Lua tooling).  At deploy time we read them with
 * fs.readFileSync and push them to the server.
 *
 * Scripts:
 *   site_logger.lua      - log_by_lua: atomic counters + ring buffer
 *   pipe_stream.lua      - content_by_lua: SSE endpoint reading the ring by cursor
 *   mgmt_api.lua         - content_by_lua: REST analytics query endpoints
 *   geo_country.lua      - module: MaxMind GeoLite2 IP → country code
 *
 * Shared memory zones (declared in nginx.conf):
 *   analytics        256m - minute-bucket counters, daily geo, totals
 *   request_data     128m - raw-log ring buffer (also the live SSE source)
 *
 * Management port: 127.0.0.1:9145 (loopback only)
 *   GET /analytics?domain=&from=&to=   - minute-bucket time series
 *   GET /analytics/totals?domain=      - lifetime counters (or all domains)
 *   GET /analytics/geo?domain=&day=    - country breakdown
 *   GET /logs/recent?domain=&limit=    - recent raw requests
 *   GET /logs/stream?domain=           - SSE live stream
 *   GET /health                        - 200 ok

 * reaches a box on an old image, a rolled-back one, and a bare one alike. The

 * from first install instead of only once a verification is in flight.

 * `ERR_SSL_UNRECOGNIZED_NAME_ALERT` — and behind Cloudflare, whose "Full" mode does
 * not validate the origin certificate, it got error 525 on a page CF served in our
 * name. Presenting a self-signed placeholder lets the handshake complete so the
 * request reaches a page that says what is actually wrong.
 *
 * The cross-serving hole this block exists to close stays closed, and the reason is
 * structural rather than a property of the certificate: we still OWN
 * `443 ssl default_server`, so an unmatched SNI can never fall through to some
 * other app's vhost. What it now gets is our own dead-end block — one
 * `ssl_certificate` that belongs to no domain, no `proxy_pass`, no `root`, nothing
 * but a `return`. Nothing trusts the placeholder, so possessing its key
 * impersonates nothing: a direct visitor still sees a browser warning, exactly as
 * they do today for a domain whose real cert has not been issued yet.
 *
 * Stated precisely, because "closed" is doing narrower work than it was: nginx picks
 * the virtual server twice for HTTPS — by SNI for the handshake, then by `Host:` for
 * the request. Completing a handshake here therefore lets a client go on to name any
 * vhost on the box by `Host:` and reach it. That is not an escalation (the same
 * client could have sent that name as its SNI and been routed there properly, and
 * the per-vhost `access_by_lua_file` rules still run in the access phase, after the
 * Host-selected server is set) — but it does mean the guarantee is now about the
 * CERTIFICATE, not the backend. Never add an `ssl_certificate` at `http` scope: this
 * block would inherit a real domain's cert and the guarantee would be gone.
 *
 * Two things this does not fix, so nobody promises them: Cloudflare "Full (Strict)"
 * validates the origin certificate and will reject the placeholder, turning error
 * 525 into 526 — same class of unfriendly page, and the only answers remain Full,
 * grey-cloud, or a CF Origin CA cert. And a browser holding an HSTS pin for a
 * hostname that once had a real cert hard-fails on the placeholder with no
 * click-through. (Which is why this block must never send HSTS itself.)
