 * In-instance "is anything listening on this port?" probe.

 * Unlike `reachability.ts` (which dials the target from the API host), this runs
 * INSIDE the deployment (docker container / cloud workspace / bare host) via a
 * CommandExecutor and reads the kernel's own socket table. It exists because a
 * host-side TCP probe can't reach cloud/remote targets, and because the tool the
 * naive approach reaches for — `lsof -i :PORT` — is (a) absent on minimal images
 * and (b) prone to missing IPv6-only (or IPv4-only) listeners.
 *
 * Method: `cat /proc/net/tcp` + `/proc/net/tcp6` (needs only busybox `sh` + `cat`,
 * present on every runtime image incl. Alpine/Oblien) and parse in TypeScript.
 * Reading BOTH files and unioning them is what eliminates the address-family
 * false negative: a process bound to `0.0.0.0:PORT` shows in tcp, one bound to
 * `:::PORT` (or Node's default dual-stack) shows in tcp6 — either counts.
