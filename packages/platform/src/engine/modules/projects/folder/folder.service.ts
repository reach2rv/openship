/**
 * Folder-upload deploy sessions.
 *
 * Lets a browser (SaaS or self-hosted) create a project from a local folder by
 * uploading its contents to a pre-created build workspace, then running the
 * normal build/deploy pipeline. Two byte-transports, one control-plane:
 *
 *   - SaaS (CLOUD_MODE): provision an Oblien *temporary* workspace + mint a
 *     workspace-scoped token; the browser uploads the tar.gz DIRECTLY to the
 *     workspace (mode "oblien-direct"). Deploy adopts that workspace.
 *   - Self-hosted: create a staging dir on this host + a single-use relay
 *     ticket; the browser uploads to POST /projects/folder/upload/:id (mode
 *     "api-relay"), and the existing localPath→transfer pipeline ships it on.
 *
 * Sessions are RAM-only with a TTL (like terminal sessions): the workspace /
 * staging dir they point at is itself short-lived, so surviving a restart is
 * meaningless.
